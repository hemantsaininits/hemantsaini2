      <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold mb-8">Who is Hemant Saini?</h2>
      <div class="space-y-6 text-lg text-white/70 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Hemant Saini is a tech advisor and product strategist who has spent years working across diverse industries—from travel and industrial engineering to legal, healthcare, and nonprofits. His professional journey is built on a simple belief: good systems aren't built by chasing trends; they're built by understanding reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike typical tech consultants who focus solely on execution, Hemant Saini takes a broader view. He asks uncomfortable questions early, simplifies decisions, and designs for real users and real pressure. His approach blends technical judgment with market awareness—because a product that can't be adopted, sold, or operated is just a well-designed liability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hemant Saini's core values center on clarity, long-term thinking, and honest execution. He works with founders and teams who value honesty over hype, long-term thinking over shortcuts, and execution that actually holds up after launch.

      <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold mb-8">How Hemant Saini Approaches Work</h2>
      <div class="space-y-6 text-lg text-white/70 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Hemant Saini does not believe in over-engineering, vanity features, or vague roadmaps. He believes in asking uncomfortable questions early—simplifying decisions and designing systems that can survive real users, real pressure, and real growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          His approach blends technical judgment with market awareness. A product that can't be adopted, sold, or operated is just a well-designed liability. Sometimes that means saying no, slowing things down, or removing features. Clarity often creates more value than speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hemant Saini works as a tech advisor, product thinker, and go-to-market partner—not just someone who executes instructions. He is involved in shaping direction, not just delivering outputs. If something doesn't create trust—for users, for teams, for the business—Hemant Saini doesn't consider it finished.
